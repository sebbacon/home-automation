# Heating

We're a family of four. Each day has different rythmns for each of us. We move between rooms in fairly predictable patterns.

I like it cool in my bedroom all day and night. The kids need their rooms to be a little warm when they get up in the week, and for longer at the weekends. The living room should be comfortable in the evening.  And so on.

The default heating algorithm, "heat the entire house based on the temperature of the living room and an arbitrary timer", means we waste a lot of energy.

The solution is to have a custom programme on every single radiator in the house.

This setup cost me about Â£200, and several days of my life in tweaking and tinkering.  I won't know for a year how much it saves me on energy bills, but I'm guessing quite a lot.

Basic controls from my phone:

Lots of nice graphs for tracking energy usage and heat levels:

## Hardware setup

The [EQ Max system](https://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/overview/0812043/MAX-Wireless-Heating-Control) is the best value system out there, and apparently fairly reliable.

The [thermostat heads](https://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/product/1378424/MAX-Wireless-thermostat-head-Basic?ref=list) communicate over 868MHz RF to a ["Cube" device](https://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/product/560896/MAX-Cube-Lan-Gateway-Cube?ref=list). The Cube allows you to TRVs into rooms, set programs (e.g. *21 degrees centigrade between 0900 and 1300 on a Monday*),  check battery life, etc. The cube is controlled via Java software which runs as a web server on your computer. It is packaged for Windows and Mac but a community member has helpfully [repackaged it for Linux](https://github.com/shawn-ogg/maxapp_linux_installer). The protocol [has been reverse engineered](https://github.com/Bouni/max-cube-protocol), of which there are various implementations around the web.

Each head stores its program locally, which means they'll continue to work even when your Cube goes down.  They can be individually "boosted" with hardware buttons.

There's a nice decalcification feature, which will fully depress and release the pin that operates the radiator valve (once a week by default)

The default mode of operation is "automatic". This means each head will follow its programmed schedule. When you override the schedule (by increasing the temperature), this change will stick until the next programmed temperature change, when the head will revert to the programmed settings.

A wall thermostat (for better ambient temperature measurement, and convenient setting of multi-radiator groups), and window sensors (which by default will automatically dial down your heating for 10 minutes when a window opens) are also available.

By all accounts the cube is a little buggy and forgets its associations between the TRV devices and the named programs. Instead of using the cube, you can consider using the open source `culfw` software, and either (a) flashing the cube ([German instructions](https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,38404.0.html?PHPSESSID=g9gjrbkpt56p5qnv1on6nnlr16)) or (b) using your own CUL module and [flashing that](https://forum.pimatic.org/topic/2483/pimatic-maxcul-and-max-cube-with-aculfw-acting-as-cul/45).


### Random observations

When playing with scripting, I found TRVs would randomly stop responding. It turns out this is because of the "1% rule" - each RF band has a "duty cycle" which is the maximum ratio of time on the air per hour. Basically, 1% means you can speak 36s per hour.

### Heads

The heads use M30 x 1.5mm standard thread size which fits most modern radiators. If you're lucky, you can just unscrew the union nut by hand (or with a bit of help from a plumber's wrench) and attach the EQ-MAX TRV with its own union nut.

Older radiators are more of a pain. Two of the radiators in my house are Comap Westherm which uses M28 x 1mm. You'll have to hope you can find an adaptor (I could), or you'll need to get a plumber to change the radiator fittings for you. Here's a [handy list of adapter sizes](https://energenie4u.co.uk/res/pdfs/Valve%20Adaptor%20List%20V5.pdf).  (The heads also come with a Danfoss RA adaptor which is rarely used in the UK)

Sometimes you'll see an `F2` error message on the adaptor after fitting. This means it's not seated properly. I gave older valves a squirt with some lubricant and jiggled the little stud that opens and closes the valve with some soft hammer taps. Where there's a long thread you have to tighten the nut a bit further than you expect to get a snug internal fit against the stud. On the radiators wheren I used adaptors, the problem was the pin in the adaptor was not snug against the inner pin (on the radiator), so I placed a 1p coin inside the adaptor, and this seemed to work


### Wall thermostat

For my main living space, which is open plan with the kitchen, I bought a [wall thermostat](https://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/product/560920/MAX-Wireless-wall-mount-thermostat-MAX?queryFromSuggest=true).  It's useful because:

* The radiator valves only report back to the cube when their state changes, but the thermostat updates every 90 seconds or so. It's nice to get more granular data about where you spend most of your time
* You can put it on the wall near where you sit: it will give a more accurate idea of the ambient temperature of the room, as opposed to a valve mounted on the radiator
* It acts as a simple hardware switch for temporarily boosting the temperature. This is particularly useful in a room with more than one radiator.
