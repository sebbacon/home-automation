# Heating

We're a family of four. Each day has different rythmns for each of us. We move between rooms in fairly predictable patterns.

I like it cool in my bedroom all day and night. The kids need their rooms to be a little warm when they get up in the week, and for longer at the weekends. The living room should be comfortable in the evening.  And so on.

The default heating algorithm, "heat the entire house based on the temperature of the living room and an arbitrary timer", means we waste a lot of energy.

The solution is to have a custom programme on every single radiator in the house.

This setup cost me about Â£200, and several days of my life in tweaking and tinkering.  I won't know for a year how much it saves me on energy bills, but I'm guessing quite a lot.
