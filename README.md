# Heating

We're a family of four. The adults both work from home. We live in a fairly leaky Victorian house.  In the winter we want to heat in various rooms at various times, instead of the silly default, viz "heat the entire house based on the temperature of the living room and an arbitrary timer".

The solution is to have a custom programme on every single radiator in the house. I like it cool in my bedroom all day and night. The kids need their rooms to be a little warm when they get up in the week, and for longer at the weekends. The living room should be comfortable in the evening.  And so on.

This documents my setup, which cost about Â£200, and several days of my life in tweaking and tinkering...
